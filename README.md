# TwentyFour

A program in C to play the game of Twenty Four on the command line. 

The way the game works is that 4 digits are chosen, and the user must choose a combination of mathematical operators (+,-,/,*) to be applied to those numbers to yield the number 24. 

The program was an assignment for CS 141 at UIC.
